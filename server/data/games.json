        "summary": "EVE Online is a free-to-play Space MMORPG developed by CCP Games. The game is characterized by vast space exploration, PVP and PVE battles, and a dedicated player base. Thanks to an ever-expanding sandbox, EVE leaves a lot of room for players to chart their own course. This appeal contributes to a thriving in-game economy where players often spend significant amounts of real currency to optimize their gameplay. Moreover, EVE Online also explores a broad brush of themes such as war, politics, piracy, trading, and exploration. These factors contributed to EVE Onlineâ€™s massive success over the last 18 years.",
